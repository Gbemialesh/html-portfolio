<h1>MY JOURNEY ON WEB DESIGNING</h1>
<H2>How It Started:</H2>
<p>I met this really cool guy in the gym when i went to play fifa and he just instantly wanted to know me and what i was about.
    Little did i know this guy would change my life.Me and this guy started chatting and he said he does computer engineering while i do computer science, meaning we already had a whole lot to talk about.
    He started up by telling me he is a really good web developer and i got really interested and intrigued. So he told me all the neccesary procedures to get to the standards hes at,I knew instantly that it would take time and a whole lot of commitment.
    I'm really grateful to God for allowing me come in contact with such an exceptional person.
    He recommended this amazing webiste <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO WEB DESIGNING MASTERY</a>
